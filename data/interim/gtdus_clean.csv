This incident is linked to the firebombing, about a week later,  of a shop in Chicago, owned by an American of Croatian descent (197810040004) as well as the murder of another American of Croatian descent, Krizan Brkic, in California, who has also received a similar threatening letter (197811220002). In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).

This incident was one in a series of 11 luxury home arsons in the Phoenix area between April 2000 and January 2001. In June 2001, confessed eco-terrorist, Mark Warren Sands was indicted for eight of the arson incidents, pled guilty, and in 2002, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for torching seven luxury homes under construction.

However, during the Federal Grand Jury indictment, prosecutors maintained that Sands committed the acts for his own twisted reasons and the he fabricated letters and claims from the CSP to carry out his plot.  Sands still maintained that he was against development of preserved areas, but also that he ""knew how to sell it,"" ""knew what a god media story was, and ""there was a sense of power"" behind the string of incidents that the media fed on.  The true motives appear to be a combination of personal reasons and to make a broader environmental message, but they remain unknown.
