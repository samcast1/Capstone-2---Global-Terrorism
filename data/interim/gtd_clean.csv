This apartment was being used as a bomb factory for FALN members, and police confiscated 66 sticks of dynamite, 2 carbines, a shot gun, and chemicals, used to make bombs, as well as three pipe bombs which later exploded at the police bomb disposal center.  Additionally, 14 printed communiqués were found, similar to those delivered to the Associated Press and United Press International in the past.

This incident is linked to the assassination of Anthony Cikoja, by suspected Croatian nationalists after he refused to pay $5,000 per the nationalists' request in a threatening letter (197809280007) and the assassination of Krizan Brkic, an American of Croatian descent in California (197811220002), who had also received a threatening letter similar to that of Cikoja.  In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).

Additionally, one day prior to this robbery, the perpetrators bombed Embassy Theater, a theater showing pornographic movies in downtown Seattle, as a diversionary tactic for this robbery (198404220016).  Around 11am, the perpetrators called the Embassy Theater warning of a second bomb (although no bomb was present), hoping the police would take the threat seriously due to the bomb from the day before.  An hour later, around 12pm, about three hours prior to the robbery, the perpetrators unloaded several boxes of roofing nails into a highway tunnel, hoping to cause a traffic jam due to flat tires, and further divert police.  However, the traffic jam failed, and traffic proceeded as usual. Around 3:00pm, the robbery took place. All the perpetrators except Mathews and Parmenter were eventually captured, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.  Mathews died in a fire in the midst of a shoot out with police, when he refused to surrender, and Parmenter became a star witness for the prosecution in the Seattle trial, but was sentenced to prison time for his other crimes while in The Order.",Hewitt Project,0,0,0,0,None,0
