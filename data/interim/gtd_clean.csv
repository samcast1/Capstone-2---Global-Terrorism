Additionally, this event is one in a series of bomb blasts by FALN members in Chicago on the same day (197506140005; 197506140006).  In one event, a bomb, targeting the First National Bank, was carried away in a black bag by a married couple, and once they realized in their car that the bag held dynamite, they threw it out the window.  This blast caused damages to the Mid-Continental Plaza building, shattering windows through the fifth floor of the building.  In a second blast, the United Insurance building six blocks away, housing the United American Bank on the first floor.  This explosion shattered windows as high as the tenth floor.  The blasts together caused minor injuries to three people.  All three attacks were claimed by FALN in both a phone call and note left for police, and the events coincided with the Puerto Rican Day parade in Chicago.",Hewitt Project,1,0,0,1,"197506140002, 197506140005, 197506140006"

In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).

Around 11am, the perpetrators called the Embassy Theater warning of a second bomb (although no bomb was present), hoping the police would take the threat seriously due to the bomb from the day before.  An hour later, around 12pm, about three hours prior to the robbery, the perpetrators unloaded several boxes of roofing nails into a highway tunnel, hoping to cause a traffic jam due to flat tires, and further divert police.  However, the traffic jam failed, and traffic proceeded as usual. Around 3:00pm, the robbery took place. All the perpetrators except Mathews and Parmenter were eventually captured, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.
