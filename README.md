# Capstone-2---Global-Terrorism
 SpringBoard Capstone 2 Project - Analysis of Global Terrorism Data

 Hello there!

 This is an end-to-end project using real world data from the Global Terrorism Database. 
 In short, the deliverable is an interactive dashboard that allows the user to quickly see the most probable targets and forms of attack given a certain motive or societal circumstance. 
 The dashboard relies on an NLP model built on Microsoft's LightGBM binary classification algorithm. 

 Please email me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on future projects.

 Thank you!
